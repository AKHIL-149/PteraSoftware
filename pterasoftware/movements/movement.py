        This method checks that all Wings maintain their symmetry type across all time
        steps. See the WingMovement class documentation for more details on this
        requirement. See the Wing class documentation for more information on symmetry
        types.

        :param airplane_movements: A list of the AirplaneMovements associated with each
            of the UnsteadyProblem's Airplanes.

            changes to the UnsteadyProblem's operating conditions.
        :param delta_time: The time between each time step. Accepts the following: None
            (default): Movement calculates a fast estimate based on freestream velocity
            alone. This works well when forward velocity dominates, but may give poor
            results at high Strouhal numbers where motion velocity is significant. The
            estimate is based on the first base Airplane's reference chord length, its
            first Wing's number of chordwise panels, and its base OperatingPoint's
            velocity. "optimize": Movement runs an iterative optimization to find the
            delta_time that minimizes the area mismatch between wake RingVortices and
            their parent bound trailing edge RingVortices. This is slower but produces
            better results at high Strouhal numbers. Positive number (int or float): Use
            the specified value directly. All values are converted internally to floats.
            The units are in seconds.
        :param num_cycles: The number of cycles of the maximum period motion used to
            calculate a num_steps parameter initialized as None if Movement isn't
            static. If num_steps is not None or if Movement is static, this must be
            None. If num_steps is initialized as None and the Movement isn't static,
            num_cycles must be a positive int. In that case, I recommend setting
            num_cycles to 3. The default is None.
        :param num_chords: The number of chord lengths used to calculate a num_steps
            parameter initialized as None if Movement is static. If num_steps is not
            None or if Movement isn't static, this must be None. If num_steps is
            initialized as None and Movement is static, num_chords must be a positive
            int. In that case, I recommend setting num_chords to 10. For cases with
            multiple Airplanes, the num_chords will reference the largest reference
            chord length. The default is None.
        :param num_steps: The number of time steps of the unsteady simulation. If
            initialized as None, and Movement isn't static, Movement will calculate a
            value for num_steps such that the simulation will cover some number of
            cycles of the maximum period of all the motion described in Movement's sub
            movement objects, sub sub movement object(s), and sub sub sub movement
            objects. If num_steps is initialized as None, and Movement is static,
            Movement will calculate a value for num_steps such that the simulation will
            result in a wake extending back by some number of reference chord lengths.
